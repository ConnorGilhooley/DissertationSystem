        <p id="Introduction">On this page, we’re going to go over some of the advanced changes you can make before you deploy your app. 
		These will require you to perform another Ionic Build operation before they take effect, 
		as they are actual changes to the code of the application.
		These are built in to the application, 
		so need to be manually set up before release.</p>
		<p id="ChangingTables">First of these is changing the number of tables. 
		This is done by adding a new option to the dropdown list of table numbers. 
		Open up the customer application folder, and head in to the www folder, then the templates folder within that and open 
		the Checkout page in your text editor. Then you need to copy one of the previous values 
		and replace both instances of the number used with the one you’re adding. (Just remember to keep them in order!)

		<p id="NavbarColour">Finally we'll change the colour of the navigation bar. 
		For this, navigate to the www folder of the customer application and open the Index.html file. From there, 
		find the Navigation bar as shown below and change the colour to one of the other
		<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ionic/ionic_colors.htm/">Ionic Colour Classes</a>. 
		This will change the colour of the Navigation bar across all pages,
		but it requires a reload, so it can’t be changed on the fly.
